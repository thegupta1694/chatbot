The remaining 29% is freshwater, including lakes, rivers, and underground aquifers.\n\nEarth is home to a vast array of life forms, from tiny microorganisms to complex ecosystems like forests, grasslands, and coral reefs. Our planet's unique conditions have given rise to an incredible diversity of species, making it the perfect place for human civilization to thrive.\n\nBut Earth is more than just a physical planet – it's also a dynamic system that constantly evolves through geological processes, climate change, and the impact of human activities.\n\nSo, there you have it!

This estimate is based on various scientific methods, including:\n\n1. **Geologic Time Scale**: By studying the layers of rock formations and the fossils they contain, geologists have constructed a timeline of Earth's history. This method suggests that Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago.\n2. **Radioactive Dating**: Radioactive isotopes like uranium-238, thorium-232, and potassium-40 decay at predictable rates. By measuring the amounts of these isotopes in rocks and minerals, scientists can calculate their age. This method has been used to date rocks as old as 3.8 billion years.\n3. **Meteorites**: Some meteorites contain tiny particles called stardust, which are thought to have formed during the early days of our solar system. By analyzing these particles, scientists have estimated that the solar system is around 4.6 billion years old.\n\nThe most widely accepted age for Earth comes from a combination of these methods: 4.54 ± 0.05 billion years. This means that Earth has been around for approximately 4.54 billion years, with an uncertainty of about 50 million years.\n\nTo put this in perspective:\n\n* If you were to compress the entire history of Earth into a single calendar year, with January 1st representing the formation of our planet, then:\n\t+ The first life forms would appear around June 16th.\n\t+ Dinosaurs would roam the Earth from September 14th to November 3rd.\n\t+ Humans wouldn't appear until just before midnight on December 31st!\n\nWow, that's a long history!"}

That's about 4 times smaller than Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.\n3. **Composition**: Earth's surface is primarily made up of oceans (about 71%), continents (about 29%), and ice caps. The rest is composed of mountains, valleys, deserts, and more.\n4. **Atmosphere**: The atmosphere around Earth is a mix of gases, including nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide and argon.

Freshwater lakes, rivers, and underground aquifers make up only about 2.5%.\n7. **Life**: Earth is home to an incredible diversity of life forms, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms.

By comparing the amount of these isotopes to their half-life (the time it takes for them to decay by half), scientists can estimate the age of the rock or mineral.\n3. **Meteorites**: Meteorites are fragments of other planets and asteroids that have fallen to Earth. By studying their composition, structure, and radioactive dating, scientists have learned about the early history of our solar system. This information helps us understand when the Earth formed.\n4. **Seismology**: Earthquakes create seismic waves that travel through the Earth's interior.
